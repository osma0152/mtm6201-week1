                My name is Abyan Osman and I’m 20 years old. I was born and raised in Ottawa, but I’m originally from Somalia.Some of my favourite things to do are: watch tv and movies and hanging out with my friends and family. I also got into reading at the end of 2021. I went through a bunch of genres and different types of books, but I would say my favourite genres are thriller, slice of life and cozy fantasies.
            </p>  
                My favourite kind of books to read are graphic novels, specifically mangas. I first became interested in coding after I took a workshop. I decided then that I was interested in pursuing a career programming, so after I graduated from  while I graduated high school in 2020, I enrolled in Computer Engineering Technology but I quickly realized it wasn't for me. I then moved to Mobile App Development because I wanted a program with more design and I was in it for 3 semesters. During my semester off I took some time to reflect and I realized that I was more passionate for design than programming. I decided that life was short I want so I left the program and enrolled in <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr>.
